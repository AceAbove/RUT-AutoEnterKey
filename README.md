# RUT-AutoEnterKey
The program uses the Windows API for window and input handling. This tool is intended for automation purposes.

The program will auto open your RUT, and automatically enter your key. This does not use global keystrokes so it won't interfere with anything, your key is sent specifically to the rut console only.
Just put the required details in the created config file.
